> NOTE: this is a work in progress

I'm actively building out this nixos configuration and working on porting over
my macOS home configurations from my
[home-config-flake](https://github.com/alDuncanson/home-config-flake).

The end goal is to have a single nix flake that manages my machines across
multiple architectures and operating systems (i.e. `x86-64_linux` and
`aarch64-darwin` for NixOS and MacOS respectively)
